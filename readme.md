# Mario Pest Control Website
<p>
A basic website to showcase working knowledge of html, css and javascript combined to make the website. Html was used to layout the site for header, div boxes, inputs and buttons, whiles css was used to style the layout to give it color, positioning and appeal. javascript handled the calculations of the various baddies caught as well as a grand total of all baddies caught. </p>
